An Exploratory Analysis of Alzheimerâ€™s Disease: Unraveling the Complexities of single cell RNA sequence Data, Capstone Project: a single RNA seq data base on gene expression was analyzed performing statistical analysis typical to cell annotation using scanpy python package. Proposed a novel cell annotation pipeline using unsupervised clustering on unstructured data. Data preprocessing included: quality control, normalization, dimension reduction (PCA), and modifying slicing criteria. Clustering algorithm selection (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, Leiden method, k-nearest neighbor, UMAP). Marker gene identification through analysis of cell populations.  Data reporting, data visualization, business intelligence, and decision making to prepare for the analysis of easily readable forms such as charts, graphs, and reports. Identifying critical problems and perform analysis comparing expected results and actual results Presented capstone project, evaluated, and interpreted the resulting clusters for their biological relevance, and analyzed the different cell types.
